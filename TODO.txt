open yaml to extract 'top level' information, pdf_hash, reviewer, transcriber, etc.
great to have a yaml validity checker that doesnt require a standard folder structure

maybe turn off warnings about incomplete final lien inside yamls

if there is a scrape_yamls in ANY of the 2transcription folders then it should be TRUE

inspect_project doesnt work on a PC!
write a manual for the ecodata package (for windows and mac)!
need a yaml tutorial
incorporate scrape_yamls

# i want to be able to look in 2_transcription1/1_pdf/completed to keep track of yamls too, not just 2_yaml
    # separate the checks: check that hash inside yaml is same as filename, and also check that yaml has a pdf or whatever
  files %>% basename() %>% substr(1, 7) -> yaml_filename_hashes # change this to be arbitrary length

      # silke wants the transcriber names for each transcription job separated here!

    # can the yaml be transformed to a json file, and if so, DOES THAT JSON LOAD PROPERLY

          # test that the reviewer info is present

    # make it switch if EITHER yamls in transcription2 OR transcription_merged
